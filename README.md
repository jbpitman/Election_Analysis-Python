## Overview of Project
Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, has asked for our assistance in reviewing, extracting and analyzing election data from a recent election. 
The election data was provided in a CSV file, included Ballot ID, County Name, and the Candidate name.  The data in the CSV file was used to determine the winner of the election.
The results of the election were  written to the VS Code terminal and to an external file
